 *algo tries to calculate the  transmission lines parameters
 * We will first calculate the Parameter R' L' G' C' parameter per unit length, 
 *  based on the Coaxial (0), Two Wire (1), Parallel Plate (2)
 * We get R' G' L' C'
 * From this we can calculate the main parameters, 
 * Gamma, Alpha, Beta ,Phase Velocity, Characteristic Impedance, And Volate Reflection Coefficient
 * The above vary for General Case (0), Loseless Case (1), Distortionless Case (2); the following are neglected, requires extra param
 Loseless Coaxial (2), Loseless two-wire (3), Loseless Paralllel Wire (4). 
 *


/*  R' G' L' C' w will be called as First Hand Param*/
	/* Gamma, Alpha, Beta, phase velocity, characteristic Impedance will called Second Hand Param*/
	/* If First Hand Param are Given, we will find the Second Hand Param*/

Some points to remember
1. For all TEM lines
L'C' = permeability * permitivity
G'/C' = conductivity/permitivity

// Second Algo takes argument takes in Z_0 omega beta
